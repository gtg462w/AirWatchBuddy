# AirWatchBuddy

AirWatchBuddy is a simple API companion app that will pull device information from your AirWatch instance. It was written with the API guide for **AirWatch 9.0** and up, as well as for **macOS 10.12** and up. Older AirWatch instances and versions of OS X have not been tested.

The information can be retrieved using one of 5 queries:
* **UserName** - Can be a username, partial username or will search as a wildcard string. 
  * I.e. User `bakerjr`'s devices will be returned with a search for `baker` among any other Baker's in your organization
  * Or you can leave it empty and it will return all devices to the limit specified (i.e. 5, 50, 100)
* **SerialNumber** - The device's Serial Number
* **IMEI** - The device's IMEI number
* **MAC Address** - The device's MAC Address
* **UDID** - The device's UDID as defined in AirWatch

AirwatchBuddy requires the FQDN or IP address for your AirWatch server, as well as your AW Tenant Code (your API code) and a username and password for an account with API privileges. This information is all stored in the user's default keychain.

AirWatchBuddy also places a preference file on disk under `~/Library/Preferences/com.jbakersystems.AirWatchBuddy` where both the `ServerURL` and `Username` info is kept. These fields are used to key off of and search for your keychain entry to authenticate for the API call.
