# AirWatchBuddy

![](Images/AirWatchBuddy.png)

AirWatchBuddy is a simple API companion app that will pull device information from your AirWatch instance. It was written with the API guide for **AirWatch 9.0** and up, as well as for **macOS 10.12** and up. Older AirWatch instances and versions of OS X have not been tested.

The information can be retrieved using one of 5 queries:
* UserName - Can be a username, partial username or will search as a wildcard string. 
* I.e. User `bakerjr`'s devices will be returned with a search for `baker` among any other Baker's in your organization
* Or you can leave it empty and it will return all devices to the limit specified (i.e. 5, 50, 100)
* SerialNumber - The device's Serial Number
* IMEI - The device's IMEI number
* MAC Address - The device's MAC Address
* UDID - The device's UDID as defined in AirWatch

AirwatchBuddy requires the FQDN or IP address for your AirWatch server, as well as your AW Tenant Code (your API code) and a username and password for an account with API privileges. This information is all stored in the user's default keychain.

AirWatchBuddy also places a preference file on disk under `~/Library/Preferences/com.jbakersystems.AirWatchBuddy` where both the `ServerURL` and `Username` info is kept. These fields are used to key off of and search for your keychain entry to authenticate for the API call.

## Things to do

* I'd like to add the ability to perform actions as well through the API calls, such as changing groups, or running commands on the device
* Add right-click feature that will open many more API calls
  * Get GPS info (API URL for GPS info (`https://host/api/mdm/devices/gps/search?searchby={searchby}&startdatetime= {startdatetime}&enddatetime={enddatetime}&dayrange={dayrange}`)
  * Get installed Profile info (`https://host/api/mdm/devices/{id}/profiles?page={page}&pagesize={pagesize}`)
  * Get installed Application info
  * Get Network info (`https://host/api/mdm/devices/{id}/network`)
  * Get Security info (`https://host/api/mdm/devices/{id}/security`)
  * and more... 
* Possibly change the name and/or logo
* Continue polishing the UI
